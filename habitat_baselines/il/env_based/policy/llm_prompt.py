Allowed action names and use cases (choose exactly one, output only the action name):
    'STOP' (End navigation task), 
    'MOVE_FORWARD' (Move forward by 0.25m only if navigable path ahead), 
    'TURN_LEFT' (Rotates the view 30 degrees to the left), 
    'TURN_RIGHT' (Rotates the view 30 degrees to the right), 
    'LOOK_UP' (Tilts the view upward by 30 degrees), 
    'LOOK_DOWN' (Tilts the view downward by 30 degrees).

    - image1: the current forward view,

Current Goal Object: {goal_object}

Think before taking actions:
    (1) Perceive the environment, analyze current room or space using key landmarks (e.g., furniture, appliances, fixtures).
    (2) Assess the likelihood: ask yourself: "Would I expect to find {goal_object} in current room?"
        • If yes → systematically explore this room through visible surfaces and open areas for clues.
        • If no →  identify the nearest exit or passage (such as a doorway or corridor) and proceed towards it.
    (3) Ensure every action either uncovers new space or narrows down the possible location of {goal_object}, avoid redundant or aimless movements."""

Navigate to current goal: {goal_object}.
Hint:
    • If the vertical view is not ideal, use LOOK_DOWN to assess immediate obstacles or LOOK_UP to gain a broader perspective.

    • NEVER choose STOP unless {goal_object} is clearly visible AND within reach (e.g., estimated within 1m).
    • Whenever possible, prioritize moving into open areas to maintain a safe distance from obstacles. However, if the only feasible route requires navigating through a narrow passage, proceed carefully along that path.
    • Adjust yourself to the best overall direction based on the provided views; if your current turning direction appears blocked, try the alternative.
    • Before moving forward, ensure your chosen direction does not lead to a conflict or blockage.
    • If you are uncertain about the navigable area, use LOOK_DOWN to check for nearby obstacles. Do not use LOOK_UP unless your view has been shifted downward and you need to restore a balanced, horizontal perspective.

    • If {goal_object} is visible in any view:
        - If an unobstructed path exists, center {goal_object} in your forward view and move toward it.
        - If obstacles block the way, choose a collision-free route that may initially deviate but will ultimately bring you closer."""

Navigate to current goal: {goal_object}.
Hint:
    • NEVER choose STOP unless {goal_object} is clearly visible AND within reach (e.g. estimated within 1m).
    • TURN_LEFT / TURN_RIGHT: Rotate horizontally to reveal new directions and alternative paths.
    • LOOK_UP/ LOOK_DOWN = Tilt camera vertically to reveal upper or lower parts of current view.
    • If {goal_object} is visible:
        - If there is a straight, navigable path, adjust your view to center the {goal_object} and move toward it.
        - If obstacles block a direct approach, plan a collision-free path that navigates to the {goal_object}. Note that this chosen path might initially seem to deviate from the {goal_object}, but it will ultimately lead you closer to it."""
